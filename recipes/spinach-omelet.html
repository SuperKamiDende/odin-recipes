    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A baby spinach omelet is a delicious dish made by whisking eggs
        and cooking them in a pan with fresh baby spinach leaves. 
        To make the omelet, the spinach is first rinsed and chopped,
        and then saut√©ed in a bit of butter or oil until it wilts and becomes tender. 
        The eggs are then whisked together with a pinch of salt and pepper, 
        and poured over the spinach in the pan. The omelet is cooked until the eggs 
        are set and the edges are golden brown, and then folded over to create
         a delicious, fluffy omelet filled with nutritious baby spinach. 
         This dish is a great way to add some greens to your breakfast or brunch, 
        and is often served with a side of toast or fresh fruit.
