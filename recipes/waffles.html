    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Waffles are a popular breakfast food that are typically made from 
        a batter consisting of flour, eggs, milk, sugar, and butter or oil. 
        The batter is cooked in a special waffle iron that imprints a distinctive 
        grid pattern on the surface of the waffle. Waffles are a classic breakfast food,
        but they can also be enjoyed as a dessert or snack. Most importantly,
        they can be made from scratch at home or purchased pre-made and frozen
        from the grocery store.
